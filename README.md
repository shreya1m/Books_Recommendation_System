# Books_Recommendation_System

## Description:
This project aims to develop a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering based on user ratings. The system analyzes user behavior and book attributes to suggest relevant books to users based on their preferences and past interactions.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project comprises three main files:

Users: Contains anonymized user data including demographic information such as location and age.

Books: Includes information about books such as ISBN, title, author, publication year, and publisher.

Ratings: Contains user ratings for books, ranging from 1 to 10.

## Libraries Used:

Pandas: Data manipulation and aggregation
NumPy: Efficient numerical operations
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization
SciPy: Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing

## Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and merging datasets.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing user behavior, book attributes, and identifying patterns.
Collaborative Filtering: Building a recommendation system based on user ratings and book attributes.
Hypothesis Testing: Evaluating hypotheses related to user behavior, book ratings, and publication years.

## Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the main script to execute the recommendation system and hypothesis testing.
View the generated plots and analysis results for insights.

## Future Enhancements:

Incorporate content-based filtering to enhance recommendation accuracy.
Implement a user interface for interactive book recommendations.
Explore deep learning models for personalized recommendations.
